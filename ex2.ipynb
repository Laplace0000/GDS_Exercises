    "The data is highly unbalanced in favor of fake articles, with a ratio of approximately 1:7. For a model to effectively learn the distinguishing features of each class, it is beneficial to expose it to an even distribution of both classes. In cases like ours, where one class dominates the data, a model trained on such an imbalanced dataset may become biased. It could overfit by learning the statistical advantage of predicting the majority class, rather than learning the distinct features that differentiate both classes. As a result, the model might predict the majority class disproportionately, regardless of the content, and fail to accurately identify the minority class."

This would not be the biggest issue as we have still chosen to classify these as reliable. In the worst case however, our assumption of total reliability is entirely incorrect, in which case we risk training our model on mislabeled data, leading to skewed results. Thus there is also a clear reason for why including this new data may be unwise."
